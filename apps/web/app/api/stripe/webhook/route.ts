/**
 * The Stripe webhook.
 *
 * This is where access is actually granted. The redirect back from Checkout
 * is a courtesy for the person's browser and proves nothing — it can be
 * visited by hand, and it arrives before Stripe has necessarily settled the
 * payment. Every entitlement below is written in response to a signed event.
 *
 * Point Stripe at `https://<host>/api/stripe/webhook` and subscribe to:
 *   checkout.session.completed
 *   customer.subscription.created / .updated / .deleted
 *
 * Locally: `stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/stripe/webhook`,
 * then put the `whsec_…` it prints into STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET.
